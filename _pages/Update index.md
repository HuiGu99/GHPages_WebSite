# Write at the front
&emsp;Welcome to my homepage! I'm glad to be a friend with you.  
&emsp;Anyway, let me introduce myself.  
&emsp;I am a freshman at the moment. I'm from Shanghai, and I live in Osaka now. I can spend a whole day, and maybe a whole week programming. I 
have some ideas and I plan to realize them when I'm in the university. I will write them below.

## Here's my plan
- A music game
  - Reasons
    - I love music games.
    - I have considered of the idea since I was in the high school. 
  - Difficulties
    - I don't have the skill of painting, making music, and even game programming. I will study them later. 
- A schedule app
  - It's an app that is made for couples. So, single dog, you can move to the next one (Laugh).   
  - Functions
    - It allows you to share your daily plan with your partener. 
    - You can also check how much your partener has done.
